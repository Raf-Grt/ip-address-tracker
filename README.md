## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Angular - JavaScript framework
- Leaflet - JavaScript library for interactive maps
- IP Geolocation API

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to integrate an interactive map into an Angular application using the Leaflet library. I also gained experience in working with APIs to retrieve IP address and location data, as well as validating user input using regular expressions.

### Continued development

I plan to continue enhancing my skills in Angular development, including further exploration of Angular features, optimization techniques, and best practices. I also intend to improve my understanding of APIs and data handling.

### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Official documentation for the Angular framework.
- [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html) - Official documentation for the Leaflet library.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - Official documentation for the Geolocation API.
